Canada’s Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines <br/>
Drinking is a personal choice. If you choose to drink, these guidelines can help you decide when, where, why and how.
Guideline 1
Reduce your long-term health risks by drinking no more than:
10 drinks a week for women, with no more than 2 drinks a day most days
15 drinks a week for men, with no more than 3 drinks a day most days
Plan non-drinking days every week to avoid developing a habit.
Guideline 2
Reduce your risk of injury and harm by drinking no more than 3 drinks (for women) and 4 drinks (for men) on any single occasion.
Plan to drink in a safe environment. Stay within the weekly limits outlined in Guideline 1.
Guideline 3
Do not drink when you are:
driving a vehicle or using machinery and tools
taking medicine or other drugs that interact with alcohol
doing any kind of dangerous physical activity
living with mental or physical health problems
living with alcohol dependence
pregnant or planning to be pregnant
responsible for the safety of others
making important decisions
Guideline 4
If you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or before breastfeeding, the safest choice is to drink no alcohol at all.
Guideline 5
If you are a child or youth, you should delay drinking until your late teens. Talk with your parents about drinking. Alcohol can harm the way your brain and body develop.
If you are drinking, plan ahead, follow local alcohol laws and stay within the limits outlined in Guideline 1.
For these guidelines, “a drink” means
341 ml (12 oz.) bottle of 5% alcohol beer, cider or cooler
142 ml (5 oz.) glass of 12% alcohol wine
43 ml (1.5 oz.) serving of 40% distilled
m/chesterhow/tale). If you spot any bugs or have any suggestions, feel free to create an issue or make a pull request.
